# Digital Habit Tracker & Streak System — Proposal (Detailed)

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Digital Habit Tracker & Streak System** is a user-centered productivity product built to help individuals form, maintain, and reflect on habits through simple tracking, motivating streak mechanics, scheduled reminders, and insightful analytics. The product emphasizes reliability and correctness (timezone-aware streaks, idempotent logging), scalability (async reminders, caching), and a delightful user experience so end users keep returning.

Primary outcomes:

- Help users develop habits through positive reinforcement (streaks, badges).
- Provide actionable analytics to improve habit consistency.
- Serve as a showcase of advanced backend design and product thinking.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Many users try to form habits but struggle with:

- Losing motivation because streaks are broken by simple scheduling/edge cases (time zones, missed logs).
- Forgetting to perform or log habits due to inconsistent reminders.
- Lacking simple, digestible feedback on progress (only raw counts or spreadsheets).
- Tools that are either too complex or poorly engineered (results in inaccurate streaks or lost data).

This product solves these issues by offering:

- Robust, timezone-aware streak calculation.
- Reliable reminders with retry and dead-letter handling.
- Friendly analytics and social features that motivate continued use.

---

## 3. Target Users & Personas

### Primary personas

- **Student (Alex, 20s)** — wants to build daily study habits (30 min review) and visualize weekly progress.
- **Young Professional (Sam, 20s–30s)** — wants to balance fitness, learning, and journaling; needs reminders and weekly summaries.
- **Busy Parent (Linh, 30s–40s)** — wants family habits (reading to kids) with simple sharing and streaks for motivation.
- **Wellness Enthusiast (Mai, 30s)** — focused on routine (meditation/yoga) and wants analytics on best times/days.

### Secondary audiences

- Habit coaching groups, small teams doing challenges, productivity influencers.

---

## 4. Value Proposition

For everyday users:

- Accurate streaks even across time zones, DST changes, and missed days.
- Minimal friction logging—one tap to mark done, with optional backfill.
- Reminders that actually arrive at the correct local time.

For employers/recruiters (why it’s resume-worthy):

- Demonstrates complex domain handling (schedules, timezones).
- Shows mastery of robust backend patterns (idempotency, queues, rate limits, observability).
- Includes product thinking — UX, use cases, KPIs, retention strategies.

---

## 5. Product Goals & Success Metrics (KPIs)

### Short-term (first 3 months)

- Weekly Active Users (WAU) ≥ 1,000 (demo target)
- DAU/MAU ratio ≥ 20% (indicates habit retention)
- Average streak length per user increases over 30 days

### Medium-term (3–9 months)

- 30-day retention ≥ 25%
- NPS (in-app survey) ≥ 30
- Average daily reminders delivered success rate ≥ 99.5%

### Operational

- Reminder delivery latency median < 2 minutes from scheduled time
- System availability 99.9% for core endpoints

---

## 6. Core Features (Detailed)

### A. Habit Management

- Create habit: name, category, description, start date.
- Schedule types:

  - **Daily** (every day)
  - **Weekly** (select weekdays)
  - **Custom** (every N days or specific dates)

- Config options:

  - Allowed backfill window (e.g., 48 hours)
  - Skip rules (soft breaks for vacations)
  - Archive vs delete

### B. Logging & Idempotency

- One click “Mark Done” records a `habit_log` for that local date.
- Idempotency: API requires `Idempotency-Key` on POST log requests (prevents duplicate records on retries).
- Backfill: allow user to log previous days within configured window; logs store `local_date` (date in user's tz) to remove DST ambiguity.

### C. Streak Logic (user-visible)

- **Current streak**: consecutive required days ending on the most recent required day with a completion.
- **Longest streak**: maximum consecutive required days in the stored window.
- UI shows streak count, whether today’s task is required, and streak protection rules (skip days).

### D. Reminders & Notifications

- Per-habit reminders at user local times.
- Channels: email (MVP), push notifications (future).
- Smart reminders: only send if habit hasn’t been logged by a certain deadline (e.g., bedtime).
- Reliable engine: scheduled tasks enqueue notifications, workers attempt delivery with retries and DLQ.

### E. Analytics Dashboard

- Calendar heatmap of completions.
- Completion rate (% required days completed).
- Best time-of-day to complete habits (uses timestamps).
- Export: CSV / ICS (calendar) of logs.

### F. Social & Gamification (optional advanced)

- Shareable habit links or public profiles.
- Leaderboards among friends.
- Badges for milestones (7, 21, 100 days).

## 7. Use Cases & User Flows (scenarios)

### Use Case 1 — New Habit Setup (Quick Flow)

1. User signs up and sets timezone.
2. Creates a habit “Read 20 min” set to daily at 21:00 local time.
3. Configures reminder at 20:45 if not done.
4. System schedules reminders in the scheduler for user’s timezone.

### Use Case 2 — Daily Logging & Streak Update

1. At 20:45, the user receives a reminder.
2. Taps “Mark Done” on mobile web — request hits API with Idempotency-Key.
3. API records `local_date`, updates streak cache, returns updated streak and leaderboard status.

### Use Case 3 — Missed Day & Backfill

1. User misses yesterday but wants to backfill.
2. Opens habit history, selects yesterday and logs completion (within 48h backfill window).
3. System recalculates streak and updates metrics.

### Use Case 4 — Group Challenge (Advanced)

1. User creates a 30-day “No sugar” challenge and invites friends.
2. Shared leaderboard shows top streaks; invites are tracked in habit membership.

---

## 8. UX / UI Concepts (visual descriptions)

- **Home / Dashboard**: summary with top 3 habits, daily checklist, current streaks, quick log buttons.
- **Habit Detail**: progress chart, calendar heatmap, log history, edit schedule, reminder settings.
- **Reminders page**: list of scheduled reminders with toggle on/off and edit time.
- **Analytics**: filters (by date range, category), export button.
- **Onboarding flow**: ask timezone & morning/night preference; suggest 3 starter habits.

Include small microcopy: celebrate streak milestones with small confetti animation and short encouraging messages.

---

## 9. Edge Cases & Business Rules (decision points)

- **Timezones & DST**: store `user.timezone` (IANA), store `habit_log.local_date` and compute server-side logic in UTC -> local conversions when needed.
- **Multiple logs in same day**: collapse duplicates; allow editing of last log.
- **Offline logging**: queue with client-side storage and sync when online; server validates idempotency keys.
- **Soft-breaks**: allow “planned breaks” for vacation without resetting streaks.

---

## 10. Data & Privacy Considerations

- Only store essential PII (email, timezone). No extra personal data.
- Allow user to export and delete data (GDPR-friendly).
- Secure passwords with modern hashing (Argon2/Bcrypt) and rotate refresh tokens.
- Use HTTPS, HSTS, and secrets management (env vars / parameter store).

---

## 11. Analytics & Instrumentation (events to track)

Important events to instrument:

- `user_signed_up` (with acquisition_source)
- `habit_created` (category, schedule_type)
- `habit_logged` (habit_id, local_date, idempotency_key)
- `reminder_sent` / `reminder_failed`
- `streak_broken` / `streak_extended`
- `export_requested`
- `share_created` (for social features)

Key computed metrics:

- DAU, WAU, MAU
- Retention cohorts (day-1, day-7, day-30)
- Reminder delivery success %
- Average logs per user / day

---

## 12. Monetization & Growth Ideas

- Freemium model:

  - Free: core features, limited habit count (e.g., 5 habits), weekly summary.
  - Pro: unlimited habits, advanced analytics, reminders, CSV/ICS export, group challenges.

- Team / family plan for shared habit groups.
- Viral hooks: invite friends to challenges, share streak badges to social media.
- Partnerships: productivity bloggers, coaching platforms.

---
